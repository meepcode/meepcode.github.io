Hi! I am AJ Bushman, currently a third year Computer Science major (Math and Logic & Reasoning minors) at James Madison University.
I am currently interested in finding a CS internship. My primary interests in the field
of Computer Science has been primarily back-end work, most enjoying my projects
in classes like Artificial Intelligence, Data Structures and Algorithms, and the lexer/parser
I created for Spreadterm.
