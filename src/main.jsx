    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a recent graduate from James Madison University with a degree in Computer Science, and minors in Math and Logic & Reasoning. 
        My coursework included a broad spectrum of areas within software, though in particular I unofficially focused on data science, 
        including linear algebra, various computaitonal algorithms for regression and approximation, and machine learning, especially Large Language Models.
        I also have experience with front-end design (particularly on the web) and back-end (databases). 
        Additionaly, my math and philosophy classes gave me strong intuition and tools for solving real-world problems that I hope to utilize to bring value to your company or project.
